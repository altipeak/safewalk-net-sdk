## Authentication API

This project presents the Safewalk Authentication API usage. The available APIs are listed below: 

* User Credentials 
* QR Code 
* Push Signature 
* Push Authentication 
* 2nd Step Authentication

### Import API library into your project

This project contains an example client App in test/Program.cs, and a .dll libray inside lib/ folder, with the methods that perform the authentication against the plataform. 

To interact with the API, you must add altipeak-safewalk-auth.dll and System.Json.dll into you project. 

Note, Inside test/Program.cs there is the description of each method and the required/optional parameters to call them.

### Authentication API Access Token
 
Before you can start using the Safewalk OAuth2 Restful API you will need to generate an authentication access-token (key) that will allow access to the different API.
Follow the instructions below to create a system user with keys to access the API:
* Access the Safewalk Appliance using an ssh client (e.g putty)
* Execute the following commands to create/update a system user with API keys: 

source /home/safewalk/safewalk-server-venv/bin/activate
 django-admin.py create_system_user --username <username> --auth-api-accesstoken --settings=gaia_server.settings

You will see an output similar to the one bellow:
  authentication-api : 1be0fd6a24fc508f45a184a87f3fc466d0c2603c . Created
*  Execute the following command if you want to list the existing API access tokens of a user:
 
 source /home/safewalk/safewalk-server-venv/bin/activate django-admin.py
  create_system_user --username <username> --settings=gaia_server.settings
* Copy the access-token that was generated for the authentication-api and save it so youâ€™ll be able to use it to make the API calls

### Usage

```csharp
string AUTHENTICATION_API_ACCESS_TOKEN = "c4608fc697e844829bb5a27cce13737250161bd0";
String host = "https://safewalk_address...";
long  port = 8445;

serverConnectivityHelper = new ServerConnectivityHelper(HOST, PORT);

SafewalkAuthClient client = new SafewalkAuthClient(serverConnectivityHelper, AUTHENTICATION_API_ACCESS_TOKEN);

// Example 1: User credentials
AuthenticationResponse response1 = client.Authenticate("username1", "12345");

// Example 2: Push Signature
SignatureResponse response2 = client.sendPushSignature("username2","abcde", "A160E4F805C51261541F0AD6BC618AE10BEB3A30786A099CE67DBEFD4F7F929F","All the data here will be signed. This request was generated from Safewalk API.","Sign Transaction","Push signature triggered from safewalk API");
System.out.println("PUSH SIGNATURE RESPONSE OPTION 1: " + response2);
```
* host : The server host.
* port : The server port.
* serverConnectivityHelper: A class to handle the connection with Safewalk server.
